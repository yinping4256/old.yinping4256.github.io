Goal:  
Specific; concise; simple; positive.
{: .notice}

## Motivation

To ensure your readers understand what you intended meaning, you can use the following principles.

## P1: Use Specific and Unambiguous Language

### Using Specific Language

Rule: Provide as more details as possible to transform a vague sentence to a specific one.
{: .notice}

The details could be "what(exactly it is)", "which (exact ones)", "where (the exact location is)", "when (it will exactly happen)", and so on.

> A computer in **one of the rooms** is not working properly.

Provide: where the rooms are; which exact computer is not working; in what way it is not working.

> For its mission, the relief organization needs food and supplies.

Provide: what the mission is, which exact food/supplies they need.

> We must have these frames **soon**, so we can complete the first floor of both buildings on schedule.

Provide: a specific time (when) you need the frame. Place the time at the end of the sentence: to complete xxxxx , we must have these frames **by next week**.

### Using Unambiguous Language

Ambiguity can come from: 

* Misplaced modifiers

* Dangling modifiers

* Stacked nouns

* Faulty word choice

#### Misplaced Modifiers

Rule: Place modifiers as close as possible to the intended referent.
{: .notice}

> Our manager suggested to the vice president that we register for the class **in San Francisco**.

This sentence has three meanings:

1. Our manager suggested to the vice president (*in San Francisco*) ...

2. ... that we register (*in San Francisco*) ...

3. the class is in San Francisco = ... we register for the San Francisco class

#### Dangling Modifers

Rule: Identify the real subject of the modifers.
{: .notice}

This could be easily identified by most Chinese students because of extensive practice in high school.

It means the modifers (usually a verb-like phrase) reference a wrong subject, that is the verb is executed by a wrong subject.

> Trying to put out the fire, the fire extinguisher broke. 

The subject that was "trying to put out the fire" can't be "the fire extinguisher". It must be a person. So the correct sentence could be "Trying to put out the fire, I broke the fire extinguisher. "

#### Stacked Nouns

Rule: Whenever possible, avoid using a noun to modify a noun.
{: .notice}

> The consultant suggested the manager allow time for a **fitness center member evaluation**.

This stacked nouns could mean:

1. **(fitness center member) evaluation**: evaluate the members in a fitness center.

2. **(fitness center) (member evaluation)**: it is the members to evaluate the fitness center.

#### Faulty Word Choice

Rule: Choose the word which has less meanings.
{: .notice}

> We were **held up** at the bank.

**Held up** means: 1. delayed; 2. robbed. 

> The students will present Shakespeare's Hamlet in the school auditorium on Friday at 7:00 P.M. Parents are invited to attend this **tragedy**.

**Tragedy** means: 1. the **type** of this play; 2. the (bad) quality of the performance;

Write concisely without redundant and unnecessary words.
