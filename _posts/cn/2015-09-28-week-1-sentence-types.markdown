本次课讲述了英语句子(clause)的所有类型, 和它们的常见组合。

adjective clause: 形容词性的句子, 即`定语从句`.

---

## 什么是`一个`英语句子: What is `a` clause?

**subject + verb**， 主语+动词(谓语)
{: .notice}

其中subject可以是单个，或者2个以上(`compound subject`), 也算作`1个`clause。

(subject and subject) + verb
{: .notice}

> Tom and Jerry went out. 

verb也可以是单个，或者2个以上(`compound verb`), 也算作`1个`clause。

subject + (verb and verb)
{: .notice}

> They went home and slept.

甚至两个以上的subject + 2个以上verb，也算作`1个`clause。

(subject and subject) + (verb and verb)
{: .notice}

> Tom and Jerry went home and slept.

但是，这种类型不是`1`个clause.
{% highlight text %}
**WRONG**: Sub1 verb1 + sub2 verb2
{% endhighlight %}

> Tom went home and Jerry went to bed.

## 单个的Clause只有两种类型

### Independent Clause

可以独立成句。

> The man said.   
> Giraffes are tall.

### Dependent Clause

1. 不能独立成句

2. 包含：**subordinating conjunction**(辅助性的连词)或者**relative pronoun**(关系代词)

#### **subordinating conjunction**

| After   | Even though  |     Unless |
|Although   | If  |Until |
| As/As if   | Now that   | What | 
|As long as   | Once  | When | 
|As soon as |Since   |Whenever | 
| Because   | So that   |Wherever |
|Before   | That | Whether |
|Even if|Though | While |
|(more...)|

## 多个Clauses的组合: Sentence的类型

### Simple Sentence, 简单句

Only ONE **Independent** Clause + some Modifiers
{: .notice}

> My red cell phone broke the day before yesterday.

* **subject**: cell phone  
* **verb**: broke  
* **modifiers**: my, red, the day before yesterday

{% highlight text %}
这种简单句的语气很Strong，尤其是连续几句都是简单句. 
如果通篇都是简单句，那它就好比通篇所有字母都大写一样！！
{% endhighlight %}

### Complex Sentence, 复杂句

Only ONE **Independent** Clause + ONE(or more) **Dependent** clause + some Modifiers
{: .notice}

> Although he was late, the teacher was not angry.

* **dependent clause**: Although he was late
* **independent clause**: the teacher was not angry.

{% highlight text %}
Complex sentence中, **independent clause**表达的意思比**dependent clause**的意思更重要。
{% endhighlight %}

#### Complex复杂句的逗号使用

> My cell phone broke when I dropped it on the ground.

> When I dropped it on the ground, my cell phone broke.


### Compound Sentence, 复合句

**TWO or More Independent Clauses** + modifiers.
{: .notice}

{% highlight text %}
Compound句子里每个Independent clauses的权重是一样的。一共有**三种**Compound Sentences.
{% endhighlight %}

#### TYPE #1

Independent Clause, **Coordinator** + Independent Clause.
{: .notice}

**Coordinators**: 也叫FANBOYS，连接两个"equal"的independent clauses.

##### **Coordinating Conjunction**

|**F** - For|
|**A** - And|
|**N** - Nor|
|**B** - But|
|**O** - Or|
|**Y** - Yet|
|**S** - So|

> nor = neither?  
> I don’t know this, neither/nor does he.

{% highlight text %}
yet = but?
——"yet" indicates "surprise".
{% endhighlight %}

> Writing is challenging yet rewarding.

这是一个simple sentence, 而且是由一个subject+一个verb组成的最简单的clause(第一类)。

##### practice

Punctuate: "Will you come over or let me go to your office?"

My answer: "Will you come over, or let me go to your office?"

It is a question version of **IC, coordinator IC** sentence.


#### TYPE #2

Independent Clause; **Conjunctive Adverb**(连接副词) + Independent Clause.
{: .notice}

> My cell phone broke yesterday; therefore, I had to buy a new one.

##### **Conjunctive Adverbs**(连接副词)

| Additionally/Also | Instead |
| Besides | Likewise |
| Consequently | Meanwhile |
| Conversely | Moreover |
| Furthermore | Nevertheless |
| However | Nonetheless |
| In addition | Similarly |
| In contrast | Therefore |
|(more...)|

学会使用：
http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/
勾选：academic
look for pattern.

比如"however", 可以找到如下patterns:

XXX. However, XXX
XXX, however, XXXX
XXXXX, however.
XXXX; however, XXXX

I like sports cars. However, I cannot afford them.
I like sports cars. I, however, cannot afford them.
I like sports cars. I cannot, however, afford them.
I like sports cars; however, I cannot afford them.(更紧凑，其实比较少见）

网页中# means a new line.
{% endhighlight %}

#### TYPE #3

Independent Clause; Independent Clause.
{: .notice}

> My cell phone broke the day after I bought it; his cell phone had broken within the first week, as well.

分号**;**等价于 `, and`.

{% highlight text %}
分号连接的这种复合句只有在两个clauses的意思非常相关的时候才行。
{% endhighlight %}

### Compound-Complex Sentence

**TWO and More Independent Clauses & ONE or More Dependent Clauses** + some Modifiers
{:. .notice}

> Although my cell phone broke the day before yesterday, I bought a new screen, and I was able to fix it.

## 多样的句子类型为何重要

因为只用一种类型的sentence会很BORING.

* Too many simple sentences sound "choppy."  
* Too many compound sentences are boring when the conjunctions are all the same.  
* Too many of the same type of complex sentences can make an annoying pattern!  
* Too many long sentences makes it difficult to find the emphasis.

### Language is Music...

> This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals--sounds that say listen to this, it is important.  
> So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader's ear. Don't just write words. Write music.
